# falling_blocks_game

I created this game in ordeer for me to start learning pygame. 

It is a very simplistic game about you collecting falling blocks.

The game was created in Python with pygame.

What the game has currently:

free images from the internet for :

- Background
- The paddle
- The falling blocks

What are the mechanics the game has:

- Each normal falling block/gem increases your score by 10 points. The score is at the top right.
- There are green gems that can have a 10% drop chance which are power ups that double the speed of your paddle/minecart and last for 10 seconds. The power up timer is 
displayed at the top right.
- There are freeze/dinamite blocks that have a chance of dropping. If the player collects them the minecart freezes for 5 seconds. The freezing timer is displayed at
the top and center of the screen.

The screen size is set to 1024 x 800.
